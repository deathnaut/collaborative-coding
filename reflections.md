### the experience
Starting off the project as driver was *extremely* difficult. It probably sounds like I'm exaggerating but it's definitely in the top 5 of the most difficult tasks I have ever encountered. I'm aware that I'm not proficient in communicating effectively or efficiently in general and the deficiency makes the task of **directing code even more challenging** since you have to direct someone else, in this case, my partner Sofia, to do something you can't even convey properly.

Sofia was great at pulling me back in when I was getting frustrated with driving. I was very clear that I knew I had a problem with verbal communication and asked for some patience. Sofia understood right away and worked really well around that.


It was a really great learning experience for a few reasons:
- I got to **learn about how I operate** as a team member and web developer, as well as see things from a different (my partner's) perspective.
- It was really awesome to **work together** with someone to achieve a mutual goal.
- It was awesome to organically **connect with another person** through a mutual interest.

### follow up research
By the end of the day and seeing the results, my interested was piqued. I read up a few articles:
